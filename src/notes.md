### background

The idea of the piece is to write an intention in the sand
It would basically disappear
Sandbox, sand mandala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala)
putting effort into something that'S going to diesappear
japanese sand garden: rake rocks, different designs
childhood no intentions
common thread: all of it just disappearing

Creating intention or creating a goal or being part of something
and then letting it go

When Kayla and Kevin watched ppl interact w it... cool: no rules, up to 8 ppl, fun
Fun and art aren't always something that go hand in hand

Accessible

usually ppl's interactions were slow and deliberate. 30+ seconds

like light painting

### ideas

opens with a blank screen?

30 off
30 on
30 off

(random delay - kayla)
sound detection
motion detection

splicing in different footage

layer frames
if ppl know they're being filmed, are they less risky?

### technical concerns

memory (use web db)
lighting

### philosophy

in memory as metaphor for all of it just disappearing
how do we just let go physically and digitally
if you can let go of creation in the sand can you let go of images of self?
